Mock meet in two days. Spend today working to the weights for the openers.
Opening weight should be maybe 85/90% of the PR goal.

Strength
- Work to squat opener (275)
- Work to bench press opener (185)
- Work to deadlift opener (311)

(from [@crossfitpd](http://crossfitpd.com)) For time
- 42 single-arm db push-jerks (50)
- 21 chest-to-bar pull-ups
- 30 single-arm db push-jerks (50)
- 15 chest-to-bar pull-ups
- 18 single-arm db push-jerks (50)
- 9 chest-to-bar pull-ups

Split each set of push-jerks evenly between arms.
