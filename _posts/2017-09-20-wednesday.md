Rest day, no strength stuff. Do some tabatas. A tabata is 8 rounds of 10
seconds rest, 20 seconds work (totaling 4 minutes).

(from [@crossfitpd](http://crossfitpd.com))
- tabata row
- 1 minute rest
- tabata air squat
- 1 minute rest
- tabata row

Sum up your lowest reps from each tabata, that's you score.
