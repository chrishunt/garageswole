Rest day today, no strength stuff. Went to
[@crossfitswbeaverton](http://www.crossfitswbeaverton.com) to do their partner
workout.

With a partner, 5 rounds of
- 40 russian kettlebell swings (53/35)
- 40 box jumps
- 400m run (together)
- 40 burpees
- 40 wallballs (20/14)

One partner works at a time. Do the run together.
